    <p>When having too many arguments in a keyword, it hinders it readability</p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Impact on Readability:</b> It is hard to understand what each of the element does when there are too many of them.</li>
        <li><b>Impact on Maintainability</b> Keywords and their callers are coupled together because the keyword leaks its internal details through its arguments.</li>
    </ul>
